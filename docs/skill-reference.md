# Skill Reference

## How Skills Work
Skills are markdown files that Claude Code reads automatically. This project bundles **10 core skills** in `.claude/skills/` — they load automatically when Claude opens the project. Optional skills must be installed by the user at `~/.claude/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/`.

## Optional Skills (user must install separately)

| Skill | Install Location | What It Does | Fallback |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| `ui-ux-pro-max` | `~/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max-repo/` | Searchable databases of UI styles, color palettes, font pairings. Has a Python CLI. | Use `docs/design-guide.md` for manual color/font selection |
| `web-reader` | `~/.agents/skills/web-reader/` | Extract content from reference URLs the user provides | Skip reference analysis |
| `deep-research` | `~/.agents/skills/deep-research/` | Systematic web research for industry-specific copy | Generate copy from business brief |

Check if an optional skill is installed:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null || ls ~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null
```

If an optional skill is missing, use the fallback and move on. Don't ask the user to install skills mid-flow.

## Invocation Examples

### vercel-deploy (bundled) — DEPLOY WITHOUT ACCOUNT
The primary deployment method. No Vercel account, CLI, or login needed.

```bash
# Deploy the site directory
bash .claude/skills/vercel-deploy/scripts/deploy.sh site
```

The script:
1. Auto-detects the framework from `package.json` (Next.js, Gatsby, Remix, Astro, etc.)
2. Creates a tarball (excludes node_modules, .git, .next, .env)
3. Uploads to Vercel's deploy endpoint
4. Polls until build completes (up to 5 minutes)
5. Returns JSON with `previewUrl` and `claimUrl`

**Output:** Share `previewUrl` with user. Mention `claimUrl` as optional for permanent hosting.

**Always run `npm run build` first** to catch errors before deploying.

If the Vercel CLI is installed and authenticated, you can also use: `cd site && npx vercel --yes`

### building-components (bundled)
Automatically loaded. Provides guidance when building UI components during Phase 4:
- Component taxonomy (primitives, components, blocks, templates)
- Accessibility patterns (ARIA, keyboard navigation, focus management)
- Composition patterns (slots, render props, controlled/uncontrolled state)
- Design token systems and theming
- Data attributes for styling and state

### web-design-guidelines (bundled)
Use during Phase 5 (QA) to review the built page against Vercel's Web Interface Guidelines.
Fetches the latest guidelines from GitHub and checks UI code for compliance.

### humanizer (bundled)
The humanizer skill loads automatically. To use it:
- After writing any copy (headlines, body text, CTAs, taglines), review it against the humanizer's pattern list
- The skill detects 24+ AI writing patterns including: inflated significance, promotional language, vague attributions, em dash overuse, rule of three, AI vocabulary words
- Check all text for banned words: delve, tapestry, landscape, foster, showcase, vibrant, nestled, leverage, innovative, cutting-edge, game-changing, seamless, empower, harness
- Rewrite any flagged text to sound human: vary sentence length, be specific, have opinions, use "you" and "we"

### seo-audit (bundled)
Run after the page is built, during Phase 5 (Preview & QA), before deployment.
The skill checks:
- Title tags (50-60 chars, keyword near start)
- Meta descriptions (150-160 chars, unique, includes CTA)
- Heading hierarchy (one H1, proper H2/H3 order)
- Image alt text (descriptive, not just filename)
- Core Web Vitals indicators
- Mobile readiness
- Structured data opportunities (JSON-LD for rich snippets)

```bash
# Color palette for a restaurant
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max-repo/src/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "restaurant warm" --domain color

# Font pairing for elegant vibe
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max-repo/src/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "elegant serif" --domain typography

# Landing page structure for SaaS
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max-repo/src/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "saas" --domain landing

# UI style recommendations for luxury brand
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max-repo/src/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "luxury brand" --domain style

# Stack-specific recommendations for Next.js + shadcn
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max-repo/src/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "modern clean" --stack shadcn
```

### playwright-cli (bundled)
```bash
# Open browser and navigate
playwright-cli open http://localhost:3000

# Take desktop screenshot
playwright-cli screenshot --filename=preview-desktop.png

# Resize to mobile and screenshot
playwright-cli resize 375 812
playwright-cli screenshot --filename=preview-mobile.png

# Resize to tablet
playwright-cli resize 768 1024
playwright-cli screenshot --filename=preview-tablet.png

# Close browser
playwright-cli close
```

### web-reader (optional — only if installed)
Use when the user provides reference URLs they like the look of.
```
Invoke by telling Claude to use the web-reader skill to analyze a URL.
Example: "Use web-reader to analyze https://example.com and note its
colors, layout approach, typography, and overall design direction."
```
The skill extracts page content, metadata, and structure — useful for understanding what the user likes about a reference site.

### deep-research (optional — only if installed)
Use when you need industry-specific knowledge for writing better copy or making design decisions.
```
Invoke by telling Claude to use deep-research for a specific topic.
Example: "Use deep-research to learn about the artisan bakery market —
what messaging resonates, what competitors look like, what customers care about."
```
Returns systematic findings from multiple sources — better than a single web search.
